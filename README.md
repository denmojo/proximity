proximity
=========

Bluetooth device proximity detection.

Use this menu bar application to sense the presence of a bluetooth device (e.g. your iPhone) and trigger an applescript.

## Source
This was originally a project found at https://code.google.com/p/reduxcomputing-proximity/

## Installation
Build using Xcode 3.2+ (tested in Yosemite Beta) and use binary compiled AppleScript as inrange and outrange events.

The included AppleScript starts and stops the screensaver with password protection when your phone is out of Bluetooth range.
These are based on the AppleScript first provided MEch.
